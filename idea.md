# Main Ideas

* Game Type: speed typing
* Game details
    * have a word bank
    * 3 levels(easy, hard, impossible) - by word length
    * giving 60 seconds, the player should try to type as many words as they can within the time limit
    * After the play, the score is recorded to leaderboard, sorted.

* tasks:
    1. Gather word bank
    2. create UI(using bash terminal as a screen)
